# ResponseX 🛡️

**ResponseX** is an **AI-powered intrusion detection and automated incident response system** designed to detect, classify, and isolate cyber threats in real time. It uses machine learning models trained on popular cybersecurity datasets—**UNSW-NB15**, **KDD Cup 1999**, and **CICIDS 2017**—to secure systems from malicious activities and support faster response mechanisms.

The goal of this project is to help businesses, cybersecurity teams, and digital infrastructure providers quickly identify attacks and autonomously initiate defensive actions, reducing potential damage.

### 🚀 Features

- **Binary Classification (Attack Detection)**: Determines if a network activity is malicious or benign.
- **Multi-class Classification (Attack Category Prediction)**: Classifies attack type (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, etc.).
- **Automated System Isolation**: Immediately triggers isolation protocols to cut off compromised machines.
- **Multi-Dataset Support**: Built with flexibility for different datasets – UNSW-NB15, KDD 99, CICIDS 2017.
- **Notebook-based Training**: Includes well-documented Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and reproducibility.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Easy to plug in new models, datasets, and extend to web or enterprise environments.
